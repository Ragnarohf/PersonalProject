# Updating React Knowledge to React 18

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm start`

Runs the application in development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to access it.
The page will automatically reload when you make changes.
You can also check for lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the application for production in the `build` folder.
It optimizes React for production mode to achieve the best performance.
The build is minified, and file names include hashes.
Your application is ready to be deployed!
Refer to the [deployment section](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you cannot go back!**
If you are not satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will
remove the single build dependency from your project.
Instead, it will copy all configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into
your project, giving you full control over them. All commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the
copied scripts so you can customize them. At this point, you are on your own.
You are not obligated to use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and medium deployments, and you
should not feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool would not be useful if you couldn't
customize it when you need to.
